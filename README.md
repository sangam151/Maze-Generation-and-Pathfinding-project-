# PathMazeProjectCE
**`Second Semester Project`**  
Computer Engineering students @ **`Kathmandu University`**  
Built with **`C++`** using the **`Qt Framework`** and **`qmake`** in **`Qt Creator`**


## Pathfinding Algorithms
The algorithms implemented here are the following:

* A*
* Dijkstra
* BFS(Breadth-First Search)
* DFS(Depth-First Search)

## Maze Generation Algorthims
Users can select difficulty levels: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`. Each maps to a different algorithm:

- **`easy`**: Recursive Backtracking (DFS)
- **`medium`**: Prim's Algorithm
- **`hard`**: Kruskal's Algorithm
- **`Extreme`**: Wilson's Algorithm

## Features

- **Multithreading**  
  Enables real-time simulation and visualization by dividing execution into independent threads. Allows dynamic speed adjustment during runtime.

- **Control Features**  
  Includes **`pause`** and **`resume`** options for both pathfinding and pathtracing simulations. Useful for demonstration and educational purposes.

- **Comparison Tab**  
  Automatically compares algorithms based on:
  - Number of visited nodes
  - Time taken to find path
  - Grid size  
  Results are exported to a **`.csv`** file for possible external analysis in the future.

## GUI Overview

Created with Qt Creator. Structured into three primary tabs:

### 1. **`Simulation`**

- Select pathfinding algorithm  
- Set **`start`** and **`goal`** nodes  
- Add or remove **`obstacles`**

### 2. **`Visualization`**

- Adjust horizontal and vertical **`node`** count  
- Modify **`node size`**

### 3. **`Comparison`**

- Compare all algorithms or a single algorithm across different **`grid sizes`**  
- Delete selected rows or clear all rows from the **`comparison table`**  
  (**`.csv`** file remains unchanged)
